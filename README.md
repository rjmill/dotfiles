My configuration files for various things

I sort of forgot this repo existed for a while, and have been editing my files
locally. I'm starting the process of getting this repo back up and running, but
my config files have changed a lot since my last commit. It'll be ugly while I
change everything, but eventually, it'll be pretty good. I've left my "legacy"
configs in a seperate branch for reference.
